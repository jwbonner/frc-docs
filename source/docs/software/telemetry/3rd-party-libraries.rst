===============================

.. tip:: Is your library not listed here when it should be?  Open a pull request to add it!

Several third-party logging utilities and frameworks exist that provide functionality beyond what is currently provided by WPILib:

 * `AdvantageKit <https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit>`__ (Java only): "Log everything"-based logging framework with hooks for replaying logged data in :ref:`simulation <docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction:Introduction to Robot Simulation>`.
 * `Oblog <https://github.com/Oblarg/Oblog>`__ (Java only): Minimalistic annotation-based API for ``Shuffleboard`` (or plain ``NetworkTables``) telemetry.
